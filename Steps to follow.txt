The code is written for Python version 2 and tested on Python 2.7.13. It is not tailored for Python 3.

Main.py is our code that uses pytesser.py from google's tesseract OCR engine(open source) and converts the images available from the path_directory we provide at command line.


1. Add Python's path to your system environemt variable - PATH.
	e.g.     
		C:\Python27

2. Add Tesseract engine's path to your system environemt variable - PATH
	e.g. 
		C:\image-to-text-ocr\pytesser

3. In windows command-line:
	Navigate to image-to-text-ocr directory and type:
		
			python main.py <path to image's directory>
	Usage example: 	python main.py C:\image-to-text-ocr\Test

The code shall make a folder named "ocr-text" and store the text files after conversion.


Happy coding !!
